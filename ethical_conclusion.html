      <h1>ETHICAL CONCLUSIONS</h1>
      <h2>Exploring the Implications of AI in Choreography</h2>
    </section>

    <!-- Content -->
    <section class="ethical-content">
      <p>Creating choreography with generative AI is a new and fairly unexplored territory. Our team identified several key ethical concerns during our research.</p>

      <h3>1. Who holds the copyright for a dance created with Generative AI?</h3>
      <p> Policies regarding the copyrightability of work created with generative AI continue to evolve. The office of copyright released a statement essentially explaining that using generative AI does not mean that a work automatically cannot be copyrighted. The statement explains that it boils down to the manner in which Generative AI is used to create the work. Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office, Shira Perlmutter, states, “Where that creativity is expressed through the use of AI systems, it continues to enjoy protection. Extending protection to material whose expressive elements are determined by a machine, however, would undermine rather than further the constitutional goals of copyright” (Copyright Office). This statement essentially explains that works where creativity is demonstrated through generative AI are copyrightable, and works that let generative AI do all of the original and creative thinking are not copyrightable.</p>
      <p> Laws and regulations regarding disclosing when a work is AI-generated are continuing to be created and evolve. Because of this, it is generally recommended that one should be very upfront when creating something that was generated with Generative AI. Being upfront when creating work with AI builds trust in any scenario, and not being upfront when creating with AI creates a lack of trust.</p>
      <p>This information led our team to believe that our final dance we created is copyrightable. To create the choreography for our piece, we took the movement prompts from ChatGPT and interpreted them to create the final product. Our piece/ “creativity” was expressed through using ChatGPT, rather than having ChatGPT perform all of the creative tasks for us. Ultimately, our team was the one actually putting the pieces together, we just gained inspiration from ChatGPT. However, it is also crucial that we specify that this piece was created with Generative AI. Ultimately, not including this note would likely be considered plagiarism. However, by including a note in the authorship of the routine about the true sourcing of the choreography, there is no plagiarism present.</p>


      <h3>2. Should creators disclose AI use?</h3>
      <p>(For information on how Generative AI software works, please refer to the What is Gen AI tab above.)
        A major issue when creating work with ChatGPT is that ChatGPT does not provide sources when it generates its outputs. 
        Generative AI platforms have received lots of backlash even including lawsuits, on the fact that the models are trained on copyrighted information. Open AI specifically has responded to this backlash by explaining that using publicly available websites (which is what ChatGPT specifically is trained on) is *fairuse. Looking at the law can sometimes be a helpful way to determine right and wrong.  The outcomes 2 previous lawsuits (Authors Guild v. HathiTrust and Authors Guild v. Google) both showed that digitizing copyrighted books, with the goal of demonstrating new information about the books, was “fair use”. While these cases did not directly involve Generative AI, they did involve machine learning, so their outcomes are relevant to the current debate(Klosek and Blumenthal).
        *fairuse: The ability to use existing works without permission from the author
        </p>

      <h3>3. Where is the data ChatGPT is trained on coming from?</h3>
      <p>(for information on how Generative AI software works, please refer to the What is Gen AI tab above)
        It is probable that many choreographers do not know that their work was used to train generative AI models.  Publishing and posting dances on the internet tends to be how many choreographers share their portfolios. The internet allows these portfolios to be easily seen. Many choreographers are booked for jobs because their choreography gets seen across the internet. As ChatGPT was trained on hundreds of thousands of websites, it is probable that many choreographers who have put their works online contributed unawaringly to the training of ChatGPT.  Because ChatGPT does not provide the sourcing of its information, it is difficult to determine exactly how these choreographers have been impacted and even if they have been impacted. 
        </p>

      <h3>4. Are choreographers aware their work may be used to train AI?</h3>
      <p>No. Our team determined from this research process that creating a dance with generative AI does not hinder the creativity that goes into creating a dance without AI. Ultimately, ChatGPT and other Generative AI software are not at a point where they can choreograph dances to the same level as actual people can.  ChatGPT can and will become a useful tool for choreographers to use; however, at this point, it will not replace choreographers.
    </p>

      <h3>5. Are creators being compensated?</h3>
      <p>Currently, there are many arguments explaining that Generative AI companies SHOULD be paying creators whose works have been used to train the models. However, there is very little evidence suggesting that any creators have actually been paid. Recently, in Australia, over 50,000 creators have signed a petition arguing against the use of unlicensed creative works to train generative AI models (Hammond). “The unlicensed use of creative works for training generative AI is a major, unjust threat to the livelihoods of the people behind those works, and must not be permitted" (Copyright Alliance).  However, some generative AI platforms (Open AI and Google specifically) have lobbied to the US Government that the use of copyrighted information to train the models falls under *fairuse (Berger). This argument of *fairuse tends to be the allowing factor for many of ChatGPT’s practices. This lobbying suggests that some platforms, including ChatGPT, are not as open to compensating creators whose work was used when training the generative AI models. 
    </p>

      <h3>6. Does AI hinder human creativity in dance?</h3>
      <p>We found that it does not. While AI can support the creative process, it cannot replace human choreographers. It is a tool, not a substitute.</p>
