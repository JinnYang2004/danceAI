    </section>

    <!-- Content -->
    <section class="genai-content">
      <p>Throughout this project, we have referred to generative AI or gen AI countless times. But what actually is it? Since our research involved the use of ChatGPT, this is going to be the generative AI software we zero in on. ChatGPT was created by a company called OpenAI, and it is essentially a giant neural network (Gregersen). A neural network is an algorithm that is structured in a way similar to the human brain.</p>

      <p>Essentially, ChatGPT is a software that was built modeling off aspects of a human, and it performs similarly to a human  (Wolfram). ChatGPT continuously produces its outputs by continuing to predict one word after another. The order of the words it outputs is predicted based on probabilities (what is the probability that the correct word should be this word) (Wolfram). Because ChatGPT produces its outputs entirely based on probabilities, the outputs it produces are not always accurate. ChatGPT even includes a disclaimer that explains that the software is not 100% trustworthy. </p>

      <p>ChatGPT is able to function because it is “trained” on data. Training a model on data means that a developer introduces the model to a bunch of different data (in ChatGPT’s case, many different websites). This data allows the model to “learn” and, therefore, make predictions when it is asked to do a certain task. These predictions then turn into the outputs that the Gen AI models produce. ChatGPT specifically was trained on about 45 terabytes of text from the internet (Gregersen). For context, that is a lot of data!

      <h1>What is Choreography</h1>
    </section>

    <section class="genai-content">
      <p>Choreography is what makes a dance a dance. It is the most integral part of any dance routine, as these are the physical moves that make up a dance. The type of dance being explored by our team is the dance team dance style. This style tends to be more skills oriented compared to others (Giles).  Dances can vary in length; however, typically, a dance team style dance tends to be around 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Choreographers have various intentions when creating dances. There can be a reason for creating the dance, a feeling or event being portrayed in the dance, a purpose of strengthening and conditioning dancers, for example. (Mackrell).</p>

      <p>The creation of choreography can be broken down into 3 steps:</p>

      <p>1. Attaining the individual movements (how the choreographer gains the inspiration for their movement). </p>

      <p>2. Creating mini dances from the individual movements. After individual movements are gained, they are normally put together into mini-dances.</p>

      <p>3. Putting all the mini dances together. After all of the mini dances are created, they are put together to create the final product.</p>

      <p>It is important to recognize that every choreographer has their own process, and these are not necessarily set in stone. This variation in process ultimately leads to more creativity in dances (Mackrell).</p>
